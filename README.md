This project focuses on developing a robot capable of obstacle and color detection using LiDAR and color sensors, simulating search and rescue operations.

About Alex
Alex is an advanced rescue robot designed to navigate and provide crucial data in unknown and hazardous rescue sites. With robust movement capabilities, Alex can traverse uneven terrain and obstacles to map the layout of rescue sites and identify the state of victims.

Key features include:
- Site Exploration: Mapping and navigating complex rescue sites.
- Victim Identification: Using color sensors to determine the state of victims (color-coded in simulations).
- Real-time Data Transmission: Communicating environmental data and victim statuses to operators for efficient teleoperation and decision-making.
